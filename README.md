Augmented Gravreality
=======

2-dimensional, physics-based Augmented Reality game in HTML5/JavaScript that uses webcam motion detection.

The AR mode still has yet to be finished, but for now you can play the game in normal keyboard mode!

Use the left and right arrow keys to move, and the up arrow key to glide upwards against the gravity.

Your mission, shall you choose to accept it, is to fight against the gravity pushing down on you in each level, while trying to make it to the other side of the level without crashing into the fiery red blocks or brick walls. Each level is featured with its own unique challenge(s) that will encourage you to play a little more strategically and carefully than the usual 2-d platformer newbie. :)

(Spoiler alert: if anyone is curious, level 1 features reversed (!) controls, level 2 features a spiral tunnel and a teleporter at the end to get you to the finish line, and level 3 features an actual maze that'll challenge the puzzle-solving aspect of your brain as well!)
